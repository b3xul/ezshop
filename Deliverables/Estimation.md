|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |                 23 classes            |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |                 160 LOC           | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) |  3680 LOC |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |          368 person hours                |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 11040 â‚¬| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |       2.3 weeks           |
